Example: 
- 1: Factor analysis for Cross-Cultural adaptation data, Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) without varimax rotation.
- 2: Factor analysis for Cross-Cultural adaptation data, Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) after varimax rotation.
- 3: Factor analysis for Cross-Cultural adaptation data, Principal Factor Method (PFM) after varimax rotation.
- 4: Factor analysis for Cross-Cultural adaptation data, Principal Component Method (PCM) after varimax rotation.
